## Project Questions and Sources

1. How much does unemployment have an effect on stress, anxiety, and depression levels?

```{r}
# Create a new data frame with counts of "1" values for Stress, Anxiety, and Depression
count_data <- data3 %>%
  group_by(Employed) %>%
  summarise(
    across(c(Stress, Anxiety, Depression), ~ sum(!is.na(.) & . == 1)),
    .groups = 'drop'
  )

# Reshape the data into long format
count_data_long <- count_data %>%
  pivot_longer(cols = c(Stress, Anxiety, Depression), names_to = "Condition", values_to = "Count")

# Create the grouped bar graph
ggplot(count_data_long, aes(x = Condition, y = Count, fill = factor(Employed))) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", position = "dodge") +
  labs(
    title = "Effect of Unemployment on Anxiety, Depression, and Stress",
    x = "Condition",
    y = "Number of People with Condition"
  ) +
  scale_fill_manual(values = alpha(c("0" = "mistyrose3", "1" = "slategray3"), alpha = 0.7),  # alpha = transparency in color
                    breaks = c("0", "1"),
                    labels = c("Unemployed", "Employed"))  +
  labs(fill = "Employment Status") +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(
        axis.title = element_text(size = 10, face = "bold"),
        axis.title.x = element_text(size = 10),
        axis.title.y = element_text(size = 10),
        legend.text = element_text(size = 8, face = "italic"),  # Make legend labels bold
        legend.title = element_text(size = 8)
  )
```

2. How does household income among those who are unemployed affect their mental health?

3. How does education level among those who are unemployed affect their mental health?
```{r}
sum(data1$I.identify.as.having.a.mental.illness==1)
sum(data1$I.identify.as.having.a.mental.illness==0)

data1a$Mental_Illness_Status <- factor(data1a$Mental_Illness_Status, labels = c("No Mental Illness", "Has Mental Illness"))

data1a_unemployed <- data1a %>% filter(Employed == 0)
# view(data1a_unemployed)
ggplot(data1a_unemployed, aes(x = Education, fill = Mental_Illness_Status)) +
  geom_bar(position = "fill") +
  scale_fill_manual(values = alpha(c("No Mental Illness" = "slategray3", "Has Mental Illness" = "mistyrose3"), alpha = 0.7),
                    labels = c("No Mental Illness", "Has Mental Illness")) +
  labs(title = "Scaled Stacked Bar Chart of Education vs. Mental Illness Among Unemployed People",
       x = "Education Level",
       y = "Proportion of People",
       fill = "Mental Health Status") +
  theme_minimal() + 
  theme(
        axis.title = element_text(size = 10, face = "bold"),
        axis.title.x = element_text(size = 10),
        axis.title.y = element_text(size = 10),
        legend.text = element_text(size = 8, face = "italic"),
        legend.title = element_text(size = 8)
  )
```
